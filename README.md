This is the solo project enigma.

Looking back on this module I really struggled and I knew going into this project I would have a lot of challenges. I ended up deciding that the best course of action would be to review concepts and work on practice exercises as well as the practice assessments in order to build on the foundation I have. I let myself be defeated and ended up not even wanting to try to work on this project. I know moving forward that is not the way to handle these new challenges, rather I should embrace the struggle and learn through it.

My assessment to give myself would be all 1's as I didn't even build out the project.
